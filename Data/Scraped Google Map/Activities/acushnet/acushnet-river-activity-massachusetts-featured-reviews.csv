The wait was very well worth it.  Great layout, awesome design of the various holes but the course condition put it over the top for me.

ChIJdYg6SaDo5IkRImqItV7nhlw,Acushnet River Valley,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncGUtWXJBRRAB,2,"Acushnet River Valley is one of the best values anywhere. $39 everyday after 1 p.m. for 18 holes and cart. That's almost unheard of. At that price point you wouldn't expect much, but the course is in really good shape. The greens are awesome and the layout makes it a fun round. Some real memorable holes and shots here. The only issue - after 1 p.m. it's a total free-for-all on the first tee. If you come at the wrong time, it could be a 5-6 hour round.

** I originally gave 4 stars but had to edit my review to 2 stars. We had a tee time for 3:50 pm, we get to the tee 10 minutes early and there are 5 groups waiting to go out (this happens frequently). We don't tee off until 4:30 pm. We play at a normal pace, keeping up with the group in front of us. We get to the 18th tee around 8:30 pm, it's getting dark. The ranger comes out to tell us that we need to pick up the pace because they closed at 8 pm and are waiting for us to finish. Well, we would have finished by 8 pm if we didn't waste 40 minutes sitting on the first tee.

Acushnet River needs to space out their tee times to have a reasonable pace of play. The course is nice and a great value, but the slow play leaves you frustrated.",6 years ago,2018-07-16T14:39:09,,,,12,,,False,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2tT_8fpHt7BErmQj_dZBo5TIp0phmXDFsRhWu=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOz1mwPrx-GDZTu2hgDgRsIU6FuIYHLtTk4VJ6j=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdJfqK_54oZQk4U1hyvwQNCkDnpDWYcNB4DcaN=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

I will definitely be going back to this course more than once a year. The price, for the round was perfect for the condition of it the only thing about it that I thought they could improve on is  to have the potholes on the cart path filled in  in certain spots.  One  more little thing that I liked a lot when I was in the parking lot getting my stuff together a young gentleman came up to me and gave me an electric cart which I thought was pretty cool.

I will say though...hunting?!?!  I am not anti-hunting, but it would be nice to know it wasn't a possibility year-round at a state park.  It literally says to wear bright colors so you don't get shot!

Other than THAT, which I have no insider knowledge of how prevalent it is or not, I really enjoyed my trip.

I especially liked that all dogs I saw were leashed, which is a rule at DCR parks, but not always enforced or followed.  Thank you!!!!

And there are bathrooms open, but they closed well before the park did.
