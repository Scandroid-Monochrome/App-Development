I will say though...hunting?!?!  I am not anti-hunting, but it would be nice to know it wasn't a possibility year-round at a state park.  It literally says to wear bright colors so you don't get shot!

Other than THAT, which I have no insider knowledge of how prevalent it is or not, I really enjoyed my trip.

I especially liked that all dogs I saw were leashed, which is a rule at DCR parks, but not always enforced or followed.  Thank you!!!!

And there are bathrooms open, but they closed well before the park did.

Cool history and very accessible.

This is a great place that's close by to bring kids, I went last year and the year before but may try today as I'm not sure about any new guidelines because of covid. Last year there was one other child there when we went so no problems whatsoever. The year before we showed up just as they were having everyone leave so it was actually a good time because some people end up leaving at that time. I never had an issue with over crowding and not being able to get in but it could be because I have not gone on a weekend, but I'm not sure. I will update once go this year.",3 years ago,2021-06-07T16:20:58,,,,0,,,False,,,[]

It gets a little busy certain times, and they close down for about 20 every few hours to filter the pool. It's seasonal too, starts up in late May and closes down around early September. It has public restrooms, and a Pagoda with tables for picnics. Very nice place.
