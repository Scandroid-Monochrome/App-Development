There were mini sailboats on the river with a great view of the city. There were benches along the way if you get tired. So many recreational options for people who use this river and path.

We ordered the Spirit-Free Dining for two people, which included the Baked Stuffed Clams. Unfortunately, one of the clams was severely overcooked to the point of being nearly inedible. When the server checked on us and asked if everything was satisfactory, we explained the issue, expecting a solution similar to what we've experienced in New York--where staff typically communicates with the kitchen to resolve such issues with great attitude. Shockingly, the server accused us of complaining only to seek a refund, insisting that we had eaten half of the burnt clam already. She defensively claimed that the clam was meant to be that hard and even suggested that the kitchen would affirm it was fine as is. No attempt was made to rectify the situation, and the server did not remove the spoiled food, nor did she offer any resolution. Her demeanor was off-putting throughout the meal. As we were preparing to enjoy the sunset and take photos, she abruptly dropped the bill on our table without prompting, seemingly trying to rush us out.

Every word of the sermon and hymn sang, was exactly what I needed to hear. I cried the 75% of the worship.\n\nIt's been 4 years, they finally found an appropriate church building.

I think the main problem is that the Speedway doesn't really operate like a standard food hall (e.g. Time Out Market or High Street Place) or like what you would expect for a 'beer garden plus food' sort of thing (e.g. some Trillium and Nightshift locations). In fact, they have a lot of rules that go against expectations.\n\nFor example it seems to be strictly 21+ even during the day, so if you happen to show up with kids, as my wife and I did with our 7 month old, you're out of luck. (Edit: I read on the Speedway's website that \"THE SPEEDWAY IS ALL AGES, FAMILY-FRIENDLY VENUE WHERE SOME BUSINESSES BECOME 21+ AT 6PM.\" That's a good policy, but for whatever reason we were turned away at 3 PM for having a baby with us. So, I'm confused...)\n\nThere also seem to be a lot of rules about who can sit where and what food or drink you can bring from one sub-section of the place to another. Finally, the last time I went, most of the stalls either weren't open or were serving a limited range of pretty expensive food.

We're not \"strictly 21+ even during the day.\"  Unfortunately, you visited us on the one day this year when Notch had a site-wide event called Forever Lager '24 that was 21+ and no dogs.  While Notch communicated that policy change on their website and event posts, we did not do a good job as The Speedway making that announcement on our website/events calendar. I'm sorry you had to find out when you arrived at the gate and spoke with our host. Please be assured that we will do a better job to communicate a policy change on our website, if one of our businesses were to have another event like this one.\n\nThank you for referencing the alcohol rules.  There are two liquor licenses at play here - The Speedway has a liquor license that extends to several businesses, and Notch has their own liquor license.  As a result, and due to ABCC rules, it's beer in the beer garden and wine, sake, cocktails on the patio.  We have recently improved our signage to make it easier to understand the two distinct areas.  Now and again, the premises rules change when a big event takes place, however, we have staff and signage in place to let people know where they can and can't take beer/alcohol during those times.\n\nWe hope you will give us another try this summer!", "response_from_owner_ago": "a month ago", "response_from_owner_date": "2024-06-11T19:48:07", "review_likes_count": 0, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": []}, {"place_id": "ChIJl7E6QYx544kRZUZdkYoblZw", "place_name": "The Charles River Speedway", "review_id": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKb2FyM3JBRRAB", "rating": 5, "review_text": "Was here on Friday for an Event/Party.

When summer comes if you are black they require you to where your wrist band while others do not, when you call corporate about the issue nothing happens. so if you are looking for a place to just sleep and eat not a bad place but if your looking for a warm welcoming home. this is not the place they make you feel less than as if your not paying to live there", "published_at": "5 years ago", "published_at_date": "2019-03-26T10:51:02", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 12, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": []}, {"place_id": "ChIJ7ykpukSL44kR_qmxytpcve8", "place_name": "Assabet River Rail trail", "review_id": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaazVYY3VRRRAB", "rating": 5, "review_text": "I was looking for places to bring my kids and I was actually investigating the local mall. I Googled the nearby rail trails and checked this one out. I'm glad I did!\nI started at the beginning on Lincoln Street on Highland Street in Marlborough and ended just past the crossing  at Sasseville Way. Even with Tropical Storm Lee overhead, people were biking, jogging  and walking on the trail.\nAll of the trail is paved. It has access to a dirt trail as well as two other trails. Trash cans and benches are available. The information i kiosks don't have a map  but one did warn of ticks and invasive species of plants, none named Robert, and insects.\nThere are multiple street  crossings and not all of the buttons on the crossing lights work. Traffic did stop as I approached without touching the buttons.\nWhat stood out to me was the flora and insects that I observed! All sorts of colorful wild  flowers  and it attracted pollinating insects such as  bees and even a monarch butterfly . I haven't seen many this year so it caught my attention. I did find a lot of English Oak tree acorns.\nThere was a small stream running along part of the trail. One area of the trail has a great view of the Assabet River!\nThere is a bike  repair station with tools and a manual air pump.\nI didn't hear or see to many  birds. I did see   squirrels.\nThere are community contributions along the trail.\nI am going to recommend this rail trail and I want to explore it in full!", "published_at": "10 months ago", "published_at_date": "2023-09-17T11:50:01", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 2, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoPxEEcIJF2-ODY34z__3oLeYjK4Pk3LpmDvdc=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_45vdss8MzVKUZ8cSQEPQ_unywIgANCnvuwGj=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSUGmuFe0vG_z1mEH8cipDi2Q8be2MTtrkTt6h=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPV14DtBwl3ardSMxLIc2DAxguCoKleZSgukPx=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGgD5XImHcSuERZi018qw7IFeJJTHGiDZB6J14=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-8jJ45MlKajtUBiUD9BK_z6TXUQsvp8_jmLQq=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGB3MKJz4K5IkZZH1fZwP1SgY5hVgZEv0nhsXD=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiGKkidFjI8yTuQ92iA_y5gmfboHtOekZVKF2U=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM80tg3XCyEBW6J3bkhV_wCfs8rkPqK8J5JHEVX=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9OGzjqutRVk4mf4iES7jntECM1x_VUxW-Yzgt=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmT2SX8OjmlP2LkMb_6llVj-5mLKcVmbzBN-KB=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP19xuqCHGuv6Ai1T2Ah3XhePiJ5QxqGOXpAb-Y=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiUXl50k778V7w13bK_JbGcEC_CNqYffJvUqgR=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFqRd81IhhrshZz_2Ih5xLdzjW9X1S70IZhHbg=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm70CfEXGC6u17WkaYjuKaumd7OudwobC5BnN9=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5z4XVQwKyE9rRWMNuBfrpyfpoRfL435gO9zLK=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5o6fwR3c3fAhkxrsE60dHXSlhJsUZ2syp8m6G=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFmtHIqScQrXnXGWzXwRWG8FcBgWPDR9UjwOCS=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN6cjixHts2uD00F7ogC_sPIokxYQqqjTeCYoe=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlbl7CpP_SHdoPsi4edbh_-YcqXTUdvXThczlg=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_RX3SAKAUlMUMya0aqEJoEG8L2wUOGRlIMIQF=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVmPhkQfQZoFmaeIYFquCO8DvggyOWOtceZV-h=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7wX0xgN3zgmX936CrfZVgLxWbnZhJngOpkEdf=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuO0Mk9NRkcoFsWu6a7NlzbhojLxXPZVrQjZ1i=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJ7ykpukSL44kR_qmxytpcve8", "place_name": "Assabet River Rail trail", "review_id": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMi1yQnB3RRAB", "rating": 4, "review_text": "I love that this rail trail has so much paved ground, it's something the other local ones are lacking and makes the world of difference when pushing a stroller.

I gave it four because there is no half star option. So here is the good, bad and ugly of this trail with some caveats. First, starting at the Marlboro end, I rode a criterion type bike the length of the trail. This type frame I'd fast, maneurable, and known to give a hard ride. It has one inch wide tires to reduce friction and increase speed. Since the first 1 to 2 miles is down hill, it was a real rush. Without pedaling I was pushing 20 MPH most of the time. But use caution, on this hot July morning, there was moderate foot and bike traffic. There are also many road crossings which demand a full stop with dismount. One inch wheels don't like curb drops of any height. This is an urban trail but much of it is deeply shaded green stretches broken by road crossings. There is a lovely panoramic view about 3 miles into the ride. There are many quiet, shaded spots to stop with a friend for lunch. There are some age bumps as the pavement crosses the line into Hudson. Then pavement smoothes our nicely. Unfortunately there are several complicated crossings in Hudson, some are dangerous towards the last few miles. The areas of Broad St, Loring  and Vila Do Porto are difficult.  At one point I had to stop and go to the Trail Forks app to figure out where the trail resumes in the mass of Intersecting roads . A sign would help but there was none. Traffic crosses at perhaps 270 degrees here and the traffic lights help little as the pedestrian function is quite short. To make matters worse, there is some road construction in progress and there are some nasty uneven pavement in several places, remember, 1 inch wheels! In spite of the issues, ARRT is mostly a pleasant, fun ride. I hope at some point the difficult intersections can be modified. The drivers in the area were pleasant and courteous and often waived right of way.", "published_at": "a year ago", "published_at_date": "2022-07-30T19:30:47", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 2, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHds5UEEraVgFlCVga2h6Yi6xDrtPziBn-PVc2=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgUQ-fCgEzfAkUOfTGdtDbq53KW6QeW0ngNIJN=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcM4NumyBaDCeiHXyoN76XYGkVJ_nSrDHEkRJY=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ9_y8XcoB6TmY2EbsZWaMMl97GotPjJn53mdi=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF0_9oPwf689vueM8iMhXZuMMnmUYy1iMEub5f=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbUN2IoTJjgx5X074nRIhJ_xjuvd4zzsi_2bEu=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKXXAVlAfKR9t7aP2Feqci3ZlJIURR5jgL6TL9=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrjcyHV6Hj24EBA_5w-0HWdDTsaVghJ2CtkG1M=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJ7ykpukSL44kR_qmxytpcve8", "place_name": "Assabet River Rail trail", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpak42MUd3EAE", "rating": 4, "review_text": "Very beautiful trail that's almost completely flat, clean, and well maintained.

The food also entirely exceeded my expectation in quality and quantity. I was expecting a basic continental breakfast type service, but it was a huge spread and all delicious!

And from my point of view is an upgrade from any other club that you may have 6 30+ foot boats to choose from but not as impeccable this fleet.I've maximizing the sailing days and spent the night in one of the harbor islands or sail to P-town for a change, you can't do that on the Boston sailing clubs. Capt Paul, Brian and the rest of the crew (Richard, Forrest, etc) take good care of the boat and available for sailing classes. Highly recommend.", "published_at": "a month ago", "published_at_date": "2024-06-10T17:49:41", "response_from_owner_text": "Thanks for taking the time to write this review, Nico  you've been a great member for our club", "response_from_owner_ago": "a month ago", "response_from_owner_date": "2024-06-10T19:14:11", "review_likes_count": 2, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": []}, {"place_id": "ChIJ-zHb6H5w44kR1uFLwAQxEmA", "place_name": "SailTime Boston", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NFppMFJREAE", "rating": 5, "review_text": "This is my fifth sailing season as a SailTime member and boat owner.  If you are looking for a place to sail newer mono-hulls or cats from 35' to 50' in Boston, this is the place.  Very well run program, boats are well maintained and well managed.  When you step on a boat it is clean and everything works.  You can do day-sails around the harbor islands your friends and family or head to P-Town or Newburyport for the weekend.  If you are new to sailing, they have an affiliated sailing school - First Reef Sailing out of East Boston.
