Overall, a great experience for people looking for a challenging activity on a hot summer day. Thank you Zach for being a great guide and great company on the boat!! To start the day, you are greeted with very welcoming guides/workers when you pull into the lot that will confirm your party, provide info, and direct you to a parking spot. The check in process is VERY easy and everyone is very kind. During check in, you will pick out your lunch/dinner option (with many to choose from), rent water shoes if you do not have ones that will stay on, and give your car keys to the front desk for safe keeping. Once at the water, this company does not make you load in your boat which was a major benefit! They were already in the water when we arrived. Being on the water is the star of the show!! Expect to be on the water for a few hours and bring a water bottle with a clasp to hook in the boat if you think you need that. Once you get back to camp, plan on changing into a dry set of clothes and having the perfect dinner after a day on the water.

The car path and the two hiking trails were deceptively angled. With a name like Sugarloaf, I expected a pleasant, hilly area with easy trails to meander through. Instead your options to reach the observation area are as follows: a narrow blacktop carpath, a difficult steep inclined hiking trail, and a less steep but still completely uphill trail that runs alongside the carpath but lower than it. The observation area was nice enough, just a couple of parking lots, a covered firepit and pavilion, restrooms and an old tower with alright views. You'll mostly see the Connecticut River and the surrounding town, nothing that interesting to look at to be fair. The breeze was nice though. I'm not sure I'll be back again but it was decent enough to visit at least once. Another thing I noticed was the distinct lack of native flora at the observation point.. they opted for green lawns and non-native flower plantings instead? Strange choice when Massachusetts has a huge variety of beautiful native plants that host a wide array of pollinators that would certainly bring up the value of this dirt mound from a biodiversity supportive standpoint. Main wildlife observed were eastern grey squirrels, chipmunks, common insects, redwing blackbirds, american robins, if you're lucky a kestrel, eastern swallowtail butterflies (both canadian tiger and black), and other various song birds. The plant blue vetch was also a common sight here, along with clovers, narrow leaf plantain and feverfew.", "published_at": "a month ago", "published_at_date": "2024-06-06T14:45:11", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 0, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPACgws5my_BXNNg8ln2h7Q1kkPrj3IdTZWgRo=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkEGBnyaKIocrwkqiKC7ucZfm1IjF_kv_DGhPO=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPT12fLCtGPhhyEY_rPoPB2ULJlfnETUIfnNsxi=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJJT7RGfIs4YkR7p-RPN0yKyk", "place_name": "Mount Sugarloaf State Reservation", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyNGRLSEtBEAE", "rating": 4, "review_text": "Really cool view! $5 parking at the very top for Massachusetts residents.

The butterfly conversatory is through a door beyond that, so it makes the kids feel like it's hidden or secret, which is fun. As soon as you enter, you are hit by colors and wings and plants and warmth. It's a really magical place.\n\nIn addition to the butterflies, there are also toirtoises, quails, koi and a few more lizards. There's tons of plants and flowers to look at too and lots of benches to pause and take in the views.\n\nThe only drawback and the reason I didn't give magic wings 5 stars is because it is relatively small. We went nice and slow and looked at absolutely everything and still only stayed around an hour (which included our time at the gift shop where my 3 year old couldn't decide what he wanted).", "published_at": "3 days ago", "published_at_date": "2024-07-22T00:46:57", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 0, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxE3AK3-JSA-FeyeQPYS4SKYLk5IDGfHgRHY0Y=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPT892g0GEmOnQURv54L9DVqAfNE6JopTIar73J=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrVAXw6ZcjdQFv6Wf_kPOpqxiE4ksLSizOkwHm=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhWZ9-FtEVsO92lSh2ipJ28h_wO_qBidPI30lL=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsPSuEl3hYUFcUBHrisKAu9LizhpB7nles7LtP=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwCMUBmAcS2zMxfbjTq8Yk8wlihFIl6wKkiyo1=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYsy2Lm-hmhxlBdauwHslT1UKCp1hy3ku7h--y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJ55lm0HIs4YkRczIKWqK3GIU", "place_name": "Magic Wings Butterfly Conservatory", "review_id": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5NThXUHlBRRAB", "rating": 5, "review_text": "Had such a lovely time here today.

There are finches flying around and quails running across the floor between feeding stations. There are a good number of interesting tanks with various frogs, geckos and insects in a room before the butterfly house. I don't think I've seen such a good collection of extras including at my beloved Slimbridge. Toilets were good, staff were great and the shop was full of cool things.

The houses are lined up on historic Old Main Street. The houses have guided tours which allow you to experience and learn the history of each house. The Flynt Center of Early New England Life is a modern museum in Historic Deerfield that displays over 2,500 artifacts from across New England. Some of the houses also offer demonstrations of life in this village in early America. All together there are over 12 different buildings in the village.\nFor all that Historic Deerfield offers there are some things which could be better. Some of the houses are currently not open due to renovations or simply not having enough staffing. Although tours are offered for different buildings they are offered at the top of the hour only. It would be better to allow for self guided tours, or audio tours in many of the historic houses. This way visitors could see many more of the houses and get to see everything that is there. The village does need to showcase more of the history that it has, and there were simply too many houses that were closed.\nTickets should be purchased in the Visitor Center. The gift shop is across from the Visitor Center and offers many different Historic Deerfield items. Some of the best houses to see in the village include the Wells-Thorn House, the Sheldon House, the Williams House, and the Barnard Tavern.

I love all of the old historic buildings and the highschool is amazing. everything is so beautiful to just walk around and look at. but if you want more of an experience then i highly recommend doing the house tours. they are so fun and interesting to do. I think it is a bit slow paced as it took us around an hour just for one house, but i dont mind that at all. I'm sure if you ask for a quick tour they will give you one :) be sure to visit the gift shop and the museum! both are so wonderful and so much to see!", "published_at": "6 years ago", "published_at_date": "2018-03-13T19:46:33", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 2, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk-VrMN8qX03NSJ1Nsl0WUJ7l6E8omY32D3eq0=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyw0874cKTqCYpMJAu19bX0v2_8Eu5BH9CaIse=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-FKZFznjOPuzUfRsbGkC53aD0-9Cf3Jtg2Aei=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvHq1oD5ZHe-iRgxcZDDm_scS6DS9IUaq_eymW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJQ4-7J7Yu4YkRO9yZXVepwAg", "place_name": "Historic Deerfield", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNc3JPTmJnEAE", "rating": 5, "review_text": "If you enjoy historic houses, you will love this place.
