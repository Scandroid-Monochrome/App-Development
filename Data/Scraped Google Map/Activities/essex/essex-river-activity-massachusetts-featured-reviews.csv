ChIJX5GYyu8i44kR8m-AFVZeEfA,Essex River Cruises & Charters,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyaUkyY0J3EAE,4,I went on a cruise about 6 years ago. I enjoyed the scenery and the tour guide and would love to go again if the boat was less crowded. I had to sit on one of the inner benches and then couldn't see well because all the people were standing and were blocking my view and I was shorter than all the people in front of me no matter which way I turned. I would suggest that the guide makes sure the people stay seated and not ruin it for those who had to sit on the inner bench. People on the outer benches have no need to stand. It would have been perfect if less crowded and the people had to stay in their seats.,a week ago,2024-07-13T13:00:23,,,,0,,,False,,,[]

Absolute favorite place for a walk. I get to explore so many natural feature and species. Give me a love for birds every time I go here.

There was hardly any parking at Plum Island, so I looked for public parking, which led us to this little paradise. It's just $5 to enter and park, cash only. There are around eight parking lots throughout the park. Some don't have beach access and are meant for the trails, but there are restrooms at some of the lots.

The first beach access point was pretty crowded and seemed to be the most popular spot. However, if you travel further down, you'll discover various wildlife trails. We stopped and walked the Hellcat Interpretive Trail, which offered natural shade and a clean, well-built boardwalk. Make sure to bring bug spray! We had some in the car thankfully. Then we drove all the way down to the end to Sandy Point. After a certain point, the road transitions from paved to gravel.

The beach was lovely! The water was clear and pristine, and the sand was soft. There were barely any people around. I always keep a beach tent and towels in the back of my car, so we set those up, laid out, and took a nap. I was in awe--how could this whole experience cost only $5?
