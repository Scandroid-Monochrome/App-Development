There was hardly any parking at Plum Island, so I looked for public parking, which led us to this little paradise. It's just $5 to enter and park, cash only. There are around eight parking lots throughout the park. Some don't have beach access and are meant for the trails, but there are restrooms at some of the lots.\n\nThe first beach access point was pretty crowded and seemed to be the most popular spot. However, if you travel further down, you'll discover various wildlife trails. We stopped and walked the Hellcat Interpretive Trail, which offered natural shade and a clean, well-built boardwalk. Make sure to bring bug spray! We had some in the car thankfully. Then we drove all the way down to the end to Sandy Point. After a certain point, the road transitions from paved to gravel.\n\nThe beach was lovely! The water was clear and pristine, and the sand was soft. There were barely any people around. I always keep a beach tent and towels in the back of my car, so we set those up, laid out, and took a nap. I was in awe--how could this whole experience cost only $5?\n\nSometimes, when things don't work out--like discovering Plum Island has no parking for visitors--you end up somewhere even better <3", "published_at": "a week ago", "published_at_date": "2024-07-16T13:58:12", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 1, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8kUSQtmGZHHQCHH6nJ34J6SY_TUphlot-VVeO=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkfl2d5atq3ALuePFMpXO7_E4qKdDH8-X2ua0C=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj8VCYl6vO-YS8vmGUIrfCcxc_htFhkAF16zLx=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNahZJMu9GGLA_J2mw2H1rLYZVnZM7IvfkSrsLn=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuuPJ3oTF8QwTejTfAbOkQaaUKhh-RHnkCDH-K=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW1rWnz-WdOPzIZnVWGSzrlUEAgJjG_Qer7PjY=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH5WsdoMCSgBSDkktyPsUURYqI2nB7r6k-_l3l=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWwP0PsA-aRewPB7F7wOHCKcf-6IiRsoGC0Nf1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJvSuuJL0h44kRv6tj7GtQS6k", "place_name": "Sandy Point State Reservation", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NW9XQlRBEAE", "rating": 5, "review_text": "This place is very nice.
