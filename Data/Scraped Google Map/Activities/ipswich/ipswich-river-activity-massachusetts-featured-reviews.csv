There was hardly any parking at Plum Island, so I looked for public parking, which led us to this little paradise. It's just $5 to enter and park, cash only. There are around eight parking lots throughout the park. Some don't have beach access and are meant for the trails, but there are restrooms at some of the lots.

The first beach access point was pretty crowded and seemed to be the most popular spot. However, if you travel further down, you'll discover various wildlife trails. We stopped and walked the Hellcat Interpretive Trail, which offered natural shade and a clean, well-built boardwalk. Make sure to bring bug spray! We had some in the car thankfully. Then we drove all the way down to the end to Sandy Point. After a certain point, the road transitions from paved to gravel.

The beach was lovely! The water was clear and pristine, and the sand was soft. There were barely any people around. I always keep a beach tent and towels in the back of my car, so we set those up, laid out, and took a nap. I was in awe--how could this whole experience cost only $5?

These three conservation zones converge to create a large wildlife reserve, much of which can only be accessed by water. Foote Brother's convenient shuttle drops you upstream where you can drift down through the entirety of the wildlife reserve back to their facility.

In an increasingly busy world, finding places of quiet to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature while slipping along silently on calm waters, is a rarity.

I highly recommend this spot to anybody who wants to observe osprey once they have completed their migration to this location. There have been osprey returning to this perch to nest and raise a clutch every year for the past six years, and it's a wonderful experience to watch the clumsy hatchlings grow into capable diving birds of prey.

Osprey have always been my main attraction to this particular spot, however, you will have a chance of seeing many other birds from this observation tower. Harriers, peregrines, kestrels, egrets, herons, bitterns, cormorants, finches, and much more occasionally make a pass-by this location.

I have to take off a star because the fee is a bit high for a primitive camping site that is only accessible by canoe or kayak.  This year it's $32 per family for a membership then $10 a person per night up to $25 per night.  So if you want to try camping one night it would cost a couple $52.
