There was hardly any parking at Plum Island, so I looked for public parking, which led us to this little paradise. It's just $5 to enter and park, cash only. There are around eight parking lots throughout the park. Some don't have beach access and are meant for the trails, but there are restrooms at some of the lots.\n\nThe first beach access point was pretty crowded and seemed to be the most popular spot. However, if you travel further down, you'll discover various wildlife trails. We stopped and walked the Hellcat Interpretive Trail, which offered natural shade and a clean, well-built boardwalk. Make sure to bring bug spray! We had some in the car thankfully. Then we drove all the way down to the end to Sandy Point. After a certain point, the road transitions from paved to gravel.\n\nThe beach was lovely! The water was clear and pristine, and the sand was soft. There were barely any people around. I always keep a beach tent and towels in the back of my car, so we set those up, laid out, and took a nap. I was in awe--how could this whole experience cost only $5?\n\nSometimes, when things don't work out--like discovering Plum Island has no parking for visitors--you end up somewhere even better <3", "published_at": "a week ago", "published_at_date": "2024-07-16T13:58:12", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 1, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8kUSQtmGZHHQCHH6nJ34J6SY_TUphlot-VVeO=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkfl2d5atq3ALuePFMpXO7_E4qKdDH8-X2ua0C=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj8VCYl6vO-YS8vmGUIrfCcxc_htFhkAF16zLx=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNahZJMu9GGLA_J2mw2H1rLYZVnZM7IvfkSrsLn=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuuPJ3oTF8QwTejTfAbOkQaaUKhh-RHnkCDH-K=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW1rWnz-WdOPzIZnVWGSzrlUEAgJjG_Qer7PjY=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH5WsdoMCSgBSDkktyPsUURYqI2nB7r6k-_l3l=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWwP0PsA-aRewPB7F7wOHCKcf-6IiRsoGC0Nf1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJvSuuJL0h44kRv6tj7GtQS6k", "place_name": "Sandy Point State Reservation", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NW9XQlRBEAE", "rating": 5, "review_text": "This place is very nice.

The Ipswich river inconspicuously snakes it's way through the quaint country communities of Ipswich, Hamilton, Topsfield and Middleton. However, in the Ipswich and Topsfield section and where Foote Brothers Canoes operates, the river passes through the large conservation areas of Bradley Palmer State Park, Willowdale State Forest and the National Audubon Society's wildlife sanctuary. These three conservation zones converge to create a large wildlife reserve, much of which can only be accessed by water. Foote Brother's convenient shuttle drops you upstream where you can drift down through the entirety of the wildlife reserve back to their facility.\n\nIn an increasingly busy world, finding places of quiet to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature while slipping along silently on calm waters, is a rarity. Foote Brothers was founded as a family business and has remained so for more then half a century.
