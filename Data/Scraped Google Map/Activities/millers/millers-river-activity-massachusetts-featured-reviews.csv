Our guide Tera was the best!! Since this was our first time rafting, we took the class II with one class III rapid adventure, but next time it'll be the III-IV. Very thankful that we managed to stay ahead of the dam release which if we had started much later could have been a disappointment, but the timing worked out perfect. Another note, this adventure package said that it came with lunch, and we expected very basic sandwiches and maybe a bag of chips, but they definitely over-delivered with great selections and taste! And tasty homemade cookies! Thank you!",a week ago,2024-07-13T19:38:26,"Hi Tracy! We're so happy to hear you had such an amazing time rafting with Tera.

ChIJiWLkeJg64YkRxD74qUmQ8yw,Cabot Camp,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNnJqZWNBEAE,5,"This is also known as the ""Jumping Bridge"" to a lot of locals.

Cabot's Camp, and it's much more popular bridge, is a great summer day location. The old building can't, normally, be toured, but still looks nice with it's age. The property has a couple micro beaches giving way to the Connecticut on the north side of the property. The beaches and rocks near them are some decent fishing or chilling spots (Also great for pictures of the French King) Parking is ample and the site is relatively clean, minus the parking lot which can be totally trashed by partying teens and scavenging animals.

The bridge offers a great area for recreation as the deeper Millers River is pulled under it on the way to the Connecticut River down the bank. The jumping is great and is often flooded by locals during the hotter days. It again, just like the beach, offers a great picture opportunity of the bridge.

The whole property is easily accessible all year round via Dorsey Rd or most of the year via East Mineral Rd

Pros:
- Great swim spot at the bridge
- Great chill spot at the beach
- Great fishing spot at the rocks
- Great for pictures everywhere
- Ample parking
- Cool old building

Cons:
- Trash in the parking lot
- Dodgy access during winter on East Mineral Rd
- During spring, the bridge will get muddy",6 years ago,2017-08-24T19:29:49,,,,9,,,False,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOboXtauU76SYQWDX3i11mpaf13vvtqzaqWH_0=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"
