ChIJl_N2mQN644kRZqOFG9Uc-Rs,Muddy River,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLb0lIbkx3EAE,3,"Although the rooms are kept clean. They are small, grey, poorly furnished rooms with NO decor. To make matters worse, you are expected to shower with the other guests!!! The staff does a great job making you feel like you're in jail!
Very disappointed that there was no balcony as described. Still great views from my second story room.
The food is decent, and during the remainder of your stay you can enjoy tax-payer-provided healthcare, air conditioning, and all the Television you can watch.
I highly recommend and extended stay. At least a couple years to experience everything it has to offer. Great place to make friends.",3 years ago,2021-03-24T13:50:03,,,,0,,,False,,,[]

ChIJ-cm86sKB5IkRdrrsPcDKsiE,Muddy River Herbals,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0MHF1bmJREAE,5,"Jenny and Muddy River Herbals are AMAZING!  I emailed Jenny out of the blue through the Muddy River Herbals website to ask if she was interested in doing a birthday party for my nature-loving eight year old.  She agreed enthusiastically and she was incredible!  She worked with us to make the birthday party of my daughter's dreams, including mandala making with gorgeous dried flowers and plants she brought, potion making with essential oils, and tea blending with jars of beautiful herbs.  She passed on so much wonderful knowledge while making the party witchy and magical for the kiddos.  The kids left with the beautiful things they made and had an awesome time.  An absolutely beautiful, wholesome experience that fills me with joy.  I wholeheartedly recommend Jenny and Muddy River Herbals to people of all ages!!",5 months ago,2024-01-29T22:35:07,,,,0,,,False,,,[]

We especially love being part of their herb CSA share, as it is an incredible resource for harder-to-find herbs. Their depth of knowledge (especially about, but not limited to, medicinal and native plants) is unparalleled. On top of that, they are a joy to work with in landscaping. They designed a pollinator garden for us and had brilliant ideas while also encouraging our own ownership of the space. All of their services are amazing - do yourself a favor and try out any aspect of Muddy River Herbals!",3 years ago,2020-11-15T16:54:25,,,,1,,,False,,,[]

They are delicious, soothing, and bring one to a place of peace.  I had difficulty sleeping so I tried their Dreamtime Blend. I was amazed at the results as I now sleep peacefully and seldom wake up .  I enjoy the Silver Basil Blend in the morning and it truly keeps me alert and calm in my work. The owners are very pleasant, helpful,  and extremely knowledgeable. I look forward to trying more of their teas and other products.",6 years ago,2018-02-28T03:31:03,,,,1,,,False,,,[]
