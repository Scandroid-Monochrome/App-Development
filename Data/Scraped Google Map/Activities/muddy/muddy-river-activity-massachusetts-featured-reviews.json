They are small, grey, poorly furnished rooms with NO decor. To make matters worse, you are expected to shower with the other guests!!! The staff does a great job making you feel like you're in jail!\nVery disappointed that there was no balcony as described. Still great views from my second story room.\nThe food is decent, and during the remainder of your stay you can enjoy tax-payer-provided healthcare, air conditioning, and all the Television you can watch.\nI highly recommend and extended stay. At least a couple years to experience everything it has to offer.

I emailed Jenny out of the blue through the Muddy River Herbals website to ask if she was interested in doing a birthday party for my nature-loving eight year old.

She worked with us to make the birthday party of my daughter's dreams, including mandala making with gorgeous dried flowers and plants she brought, potion making with essential oils, and tea blending with jars of beautiful herbs.  She passed on so much wonderful knowledge while making the party witchy and magical for the kiddos.  The kids left with the beautiful things they made and had an awesome time.
