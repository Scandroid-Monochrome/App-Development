In addition to restrooms, educational programs, and information, the center has displays and exhibits that introduce aspects of the forest's wildlife and human history.\n\n2) Swimming: The beach at the north end of Pearce Lake also has a first aid station during the summer months.

I must say, I was impressed with the facility when I walked in. It has that nostalgic \"old school\" roller skating rink smell, that everyone who stepped into one during the prime of roller skating in the 1980s and 1990s. The staff were all friendly, they search your belongings when you walk in (I think that is added piece of mind) that someone won't get stabbed or capped on the rink or even in the building. The music is plenty loud, enough to get those feet moving and a groove started. The song selection was great too. They play a mix of everything. The floor is nice, it has a nice feel when you're rolling. It's wood, the best kind of skate floor you can be on. They even have a JR rink off to the side, where you can go work on technique or even get your skate legs. I am not giving it a complete 5 star, because I think they can do better with organizing the rink a little better. I am an experienced skater and a couple of times; I thought I was going to be run over and killed by a some of them who are just skating recklessly. And then others who are doing tricks in the travel area, which jams up the ability to spread out. Not everyone wants to speed skate. I frequent other area rinks and they set the rink up for all ability levels and all speed levels. And if you are flying around the rink, you get a warning and told to \"slow down\" and then anything subsequent, the consequences get a little stiffer. Just a little food for thought. I otherwise love this place and you have gained a regular patron. I do recommend anyone reading this, to give it a try. I think you will like it. I loved it. It is a great place. It is one of the senior skating rinks, in the area, having opened in 1981 and 43 years later is still doing something right. Thank you, Roller World. I'll be in on adult night, from here forward.

On the recommendation of a good friend I took the prep courses even though I considered myself an experienced gym goer. Humbled but excited is an understatement after the first few days. Literally every day was something new and that's what made it so exciting and fun. I found myself anxiously waiting to see what the next workout was and then immediately looking at ways to improve on skills that I had just learned. The coaches also make EVERY single person able to feel comfortable in their abilities at the gym. In any given class you would find athletes from every fitness level and skill level, young to old, male to female etc. Not only is everyone welcome, but they make it welcoming for everyone. And if you come, put in the work, and also have fun, the results will be noticed in both body and mind.\n\nAll fitness aside, it's the community of CrossFit Route 1 that really kept me coming back. I can 100% say that I've made lifelong friends met people who truly care about how I am as a person. The most fun that I've had at CF Route 1 has been cheering on my friends, or different events when I wasn't even working out. I had been going to CrossFit Route 1 for 4 years before I reluctantly had to switch because I have moved. But even though I'm not technically a member, the coaches and athletes, who are now friends still check in on me and we have maintained our friendship. I still come back and pop in with my daughter just to hang out when we can.\n\nJared and Tracy have done a great job creating a very fun and welcoming environment and community that focuses on getting EVERYONE better.

It felt weird that strangers wanted to know my name and were willing to help me adjust to the workouts. But after a month, I knew this was the community for me. I've never been around a group of adults who are so committed to each others health and well being.

So much so that even on my worst day getting to the gym is the highlight.\nThe diversity of the people working out at the gym is special and the coaches give personal focus during class time to help each of us meet our goals. The coaches are incredibly knowledgeable on how to make small adjustments to your lifestyle to fit the goal of living a healthy life with advice on diet, exercises, how hard to push yourself and how to do it safely. Most importantly, they all want you to know how to build your whole body into something that you can use to enjoy daily activities and even to do some things that might have seemed impossible.\nJared and Tracy have built something very special. He has a place where people work hard, have fun doing it, and support each other along the way.

I'll list only SOME of the issues below:\n\n*Decline bench is off on one side making it easier to injure your shoulders if you aren't careful and are mindful to readjust. It shouldn't be a requirement to remember that a bench is improperly installed before a lift especially since it's been like this for at least two years now.\n\n*They do not have enough barbells for the weight training area/turf which is where a lot of people take them to and don't bring them back.\n\n*unlike other gyms they don't have a person to re rack peoples weights and pick things up throughout the day. They also do not actually enforce any of their roles to encourage people to pick up after themselves.\n\n*The jacuzzi has been broken or \"closed for maintenance\" the majority of days that I have shown up to the gym versus actually functional.\n\n*Handicap spots are not respected and if a person is blocking access, nothing is done about it.\n\n*There are no buttons to open any of the doors making it hard or impossible for those with limited mobility to come to the gym and try and better themselves.\n\n*The chair that is supposed to help disabled people get into the pool has been broken for god knows how long and nothing has been done to actually make it functional and operational.\n\n*the handicap bathrooms, shower stall and handicapped area of machines is not respected and gets taken up by people all the time and no one questions it unless someone goes to the desk and complains.\n\n*The pool was a huge reason for me joining this gym and I now cannot and have not been able to use it for atleast 4 months now due to the chair being broken and being offered no other options other than to wait for \"batteries to come in\".\n\nI shouldn't have to consistently and constantly be asking for accessibility. I should be able to walk in and use the gym that I am PAYING FOR to its fullest extent.\n\nThis gym could truly be accessible and be great in the way that they claim to strive to be but are falling short.\n\nI am posting this review in hopes that it may make a higher up pay attention to their rating and force them to care about the issues especially since they have the time to make prices higher and higher for new people coming in while fixing none of the major issues.\n\nUpdate: the gym is worse than a year ago when I wrote this review. Gross and unsafe. None of the issues I listed in this review or that I've reported have been fixed. New ones have popped up and more and more equipment keeps failing. They've also now started to shut off the lights inside of the gym the last few months even while they're open to make people leave. I understand not wanting people to linger at the end of your shift or after close but this is outright dangerous! They'll shut the lights off while people are mid workout as well as the lights to the locker rooms without checking if people are in there (PRE CLOSE). I've gotten sass when having to ask for the lights to be turned on or told to use my flashlight when I only have one free hand and the gym is open which I'm paying for!!! This location treats its customers as if they were doing them a favor by allowing us to be there instead of people who are paying to be able to use the premises.\n\nAlso, a lot of these positive reviews are fake! The gym has now run multiple promotions where if you leave a POSITIVE review they'll give you discounts or guest passes.\n\nUpdate 4/23/2024:\n\nAn employee shut off lights, claimed the gym was closed before their closing time. When I spoke up and said they weren't closed, the same two employees kept coming up & harassing me. I tried getting their names to make a report & the next time I came in I was told I was revoked. I've multiple times asked for why I'm being revoked in writing. Every time I have a verbal conversation with them I get told different stories. They are avoiding accountability as well as unwilling to be clear in writing. They have complaints about me that are related to me reporting safety issues.", "published_at": "2 months ago", "published_at_date": "2023-02-06T05:20:04", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 9, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO0rfVoRkI61tXpDYr39lRpsc6UX1v-wAdxRRq=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORwvZxilGR9mTqtQi4KjzYjd4MKtMQ_f9UP7p-=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMqrTm-7D4NEHgnLUPRpocWAbUHlURUisppWwh=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPSW3G395MPGX3WsRLlOEafWy4Dukdv8qTRKGS=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGmDyzuUA9sdr2h2nUURT7speD12MzR5MVgfNc=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr8LgtO-31Fmwahg2bdMnpUeQVkgV7wVpe5Th7=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj8vBDgBG64Dy0-dknuKzr9vpr9a89NYHJUKHe=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJA_-lh0Jy44kRtEQLjsD9JMg", "place_name": "LA Fitness", "review_id": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREeEpXQnFRRRAB", "rating": 5, "review_text": "Been coming to this gym for about 2 years now and have absolutely no complaints.

Sean didn't make me feel bad for requesting changes and got back to me quickly with each edit. Once I approved the final mock-up, he got the order to me quickly, and it was just perfect! My husband and our guests loved it! At one point in the evening, one of our (possibly very intoxicated) guests came up and gushed to me about the pumpkin. To quote him, \"That pumpkin is amazing! It's like...YOU! Like, a portrait of YOU! In a PUMPKIN!!!\" I could not have said it better myself.\n\nWe got married October 2021 before Halloween, and we have now gotten to enjoy our pumpkin for two Halloweens. Each year, adults bringing their kids by for trick-or-treating stop and gape at our pumpkin and ask if it's real and if we carved it. (Someone this year literally had their mouth hanging open after they saw it, it's that impressive!) It is a keepsake we will treasure for many years to come! I highly recommend ordering a custom piece from Sean. He is professional, communicative, and his work is amazingly affordable for the quality.

I HIGHLY recommend doing this if you are looking for a fun activity to do with a group of people!! Originally I booked the bachelorette package with Chris for my friend that was getting married and he was SO helpful. Everything was last minute and he worked so hard and efficiently to make things work and get everything to my apartment in time.\n\nUnfortunately the weather was SO bad the day we were planning to do the scavenger hunt and it was downpouring so I asked Chris if we can reschedule (of course he said yes - he is the best)!! But as time went by we realized it would be impossible since my friend got married the week after and most of her bridesmaids were visiting out of state so they weren't around.\n\nI asked Chris if it would be possible if we could switch the scavenger hunt from a bachelorette theme to a birthday one (for another friend) that way I can still use most of what Chris had sent for the bachelorette one and we wouldn't lose our money's worth. Chris was SO sweet about it and he changed all of the questions and changed the theme free of cost! He even sent out a new package to my apartment with a different pamphlet, different team names, etc all so it matches the Birthday Girl- free of charge!\n\nEven the day of Chris and his team were sooo easy going and so sweet! We were running late and they pushed back the scavenger hunt an entire hour for us. The  scavenger hunt itself was an amazing time!!!!! The app ran so smoothly and you can see everything the other team is doing and the points their racking up too. I also think this is a great thing to do if you have people visiting from out of town and you want to do something fun but show them around and have them see new places at the same time. I've been living in the city for a few years now and I visited a lot of new places while doing the scavenger hunt!!!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND! also super affordable especially if you split it with the group!", "published_at": "3 years ago", "published_at_date": "2021-07-19T20:43:15", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 0, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": []}, {"place_id": "ChIJPfmAYw4S44kRl2DJtY0blWU", "place_name": "CASHUNT", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdEpXYU93EAE", "rating": 5, "review_text": "I scheduled CASHUNT for 60 high school students from Oklahoma .

The safety first approach to swimming, the small class sizes, the lesson plans, and the TEACHERS have all been amazing. Special shout out to Lily who is exceptional with the kiddos. My son looks forward every week to his swim lesson and to perfecting the specific skills required to graduate through each level. His progress has been remarkable and quick! He went from being afraid to get his face wet to dunking his head all the way in the water while he swims like a shark! Every class he practices rolling over from a face down position to floating on his back. And it is the only swimming program I have found nearby that not only teaches water acclimation and safety, but also the foundations of swimming strokes! My son is delighted by \"monkey, airplane, soldier\" and the speed that his legs can contribute to his inertia! Watching his confidence brings tears to my eyes as I know that these skills could literally save his life. Coach Pete does a wonderful job making students and their families feel truly welcome and the facilities are equally welcoming and accessible with no stairs and a direct entrance from the spacious parking lot. With an intuitive app and website, there are many scheduling options to choose from and multiple levels in each half hour lesson block so that as you progress through each level you can still find a class time that works for you. This is especially helpful if you have multiple family members who are swimming at different levels.

Our daughter for some reason had a really strong fear of putting her head under water. The BSS staff heard our concerns and set about a systematic, patient, and effective approach to not just teach our daughter to swim but perhaps even more importantly how to overcome her fears in a healthy way! I'm a licensed psychotherapist, so I was pretty impressed at how they helped her work through her anxiety. I also really appreciate their policy about allowing parents to be present, but only in encouraging and supportive ways. I heard of one Dad who was telling his kid if he didn't get in the pool, he'd push him him in! The poor kid seemed so scared, and this dad's way of literally pushing his kid through fear is not only totally counterproductive, but it stresses out all the other kids too. Thankfully, the BSS owner handles these types of situations well so the swim teachers can be free to work their magic with the kids in a safe, fun, tried, and true way!

My son spent 5 years somewhere else before here and thought it would be different since we could actually sit in on the lessons, which we couldn't do at the previous place we went. Well after 4 weeks before today (Week 4 was the first one I was present for, my wife did the first 3 weeks) , he was no better off than he was before he came here. He only started doing what they asked after my interventions, which were no worse than me saying \"You got this buddy\" ,\"You can do it\" or \"Come on, you got to get your hair wet\", promising him rewards and followed by \"Good job\" when he did it. I was then told by the \"Owner\" that he knew how to get my child to respond better than me then accused me of making my son nervous when he WASN'T LISTENING BEFORE to the instructor. After a low key argument with him, I was told that I was not welcome back which is ok, because my son didn't learn anything anyways after the 5th week. So again, as a parent, if you child only responds to your words, DO NOT COME HERE. And btw, singing nursery rhymes to a 9 year old to encourage them to swim DOESN'T WORK. For the price you pay per lesson, go somewhere else.\n\n*To reply to the response.\n\nI was disrupting no one. My child's class was the only one. I only spoke when it was MY CHILD'S turn.

I was watching how the kids were doing the forward roll with the reliance on their heads with necks bending which is a huge, dangerous mistake. The first rule every gymnastics professional knows: hide your head between legs, land on the upper part of your back, not your head. These coaches did not watch and did not TEACH the kids to do the forward roll correctly. It happens with the other exercises as well. When I went to the coaches and said that they ignored dangerous things they did not get me. I asked them: what you should land on - and they could not answer. Sent me to a manager. The manager actually did not care, nodded and returned me money. Of course I was not going to go back to that place but for them it is even better - no problematic customers.\nthe place is a machine of gathering money, a conveyor.

I went back to YMCA with a huuuuuge room for gymnastics, better equipment and more attentive coaches.\nBe mindful when you choose the coaches, gymnastics is a very traumatic sport, safety is first. Better choose coaches from the Eastern Europe or USSR who have always had wonderful sport schools, focused on quality, not money.\nI'm shocked by the previous 5 star reviews. After reading them I realized parents just could not make a relevant analysis and judgement, perhaps due to lack of experience.

There's normally 3-4 parts/rooms to 1 quest line. There are no rules to the room that are posted, the only hints you have about the quest is the plaque on the door with the name of the quest and maybe a one liner. The rooms are run by a program, no live humans watching you like an escape room.\n\nThe rooms are laid out in multiple hallways, doors that start the quest will have a plaque. There's a screen over the door that will be a solid green emblem or blinking green emblem. Solid means the room is empty and ready to be entered, blinking means the room is occupied.\n\nThere's a screen in the room that will have the flashing green emblem when you enter and the quest is live. If you fail the quest by doing something you shouldn't or time out you will buzz out and the screen/emblem will turn red. It's not always clear how or why you failed the room. Once you exit you can immediately try again if there's no line and the emblem is a solid green. Depending on the time there's normally a 1-2 group queue but the line moves fast. Generally you have less than a 5 minute wait to get into a room but some waits are longer pending the line. The bonus about failing frequently is many groups can try at once and some group who can get through a section quickly will make room for the next group to start.\n\nYou need a group between 3-5, all rooms can be done with that number but some rooms are easier or harder with a different number. If you're super hardcore and have done most of the rooms you can take the quest master challenge and attempt to complete all the quests in 4 hours. This will likely require several visits prior to your attempt to train. We spent about 4 hours just checking out the different rooms and only completed 2, came close to completing another 2 and failed many times. Would definitely come back here.\n\nThe area is pretty safe and you had packs of middle school kids running around on rainy days with no direct parental supervision. There's a waiting area upstairs where you can sit and relax there are some drinks available. Staff was amazing and super helpful and kind.
