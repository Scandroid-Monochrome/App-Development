The first thing that struck me was the sheer beauty of the park. The serene pond and expansive fields provide a picturesque backdrop for a day of outdoor adventure. Whether you're looking to have a leisurely picnic, go for a hike, or simply relax in the peaceful surroundings, this park has it all.

But what truly sets Great Brook Farm State Park apart is the incredible array of farm animals they have on display. I felt like a kid again as I watched the cows, goats, chickens, and pigs go about their daily routines. It's a fantastic opportunity for children (and adults!) to connect with nature and learn about farm life firsthand.

And of course, the highlight of my visit was the ice cream. I couldn't resist trying a scoop, and it was nothing short of heavenly. The flavors were so rich and delicious.

What makes this place even better is that it's an ideal spot for the whole family. There are plenty of activities to keep the kids entertained, from exploring the farm to playing by the pond. It's an educational and fun experience rolled into one.

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, eager to answer any questions and make our visit enjoyable. The overall atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming.

Great Brook Farm State Park is a true treasure. Whether you're a nature lover, a foodie, or simply looking for a great day out with your loved ones, this place has it all.

As a girl with ADHD, which manifested as unintentionally disruptive behavior and a difficulty concentrating in school, I had a hard time fitting in with my peers. I was uncoordinated with sports and dance, loosing focus and unmotivated by a false sense of competition. At school I was teased for getting special help for my dyslexia. Many times I fell into depressions. Academy was the one activity I reliably looked forward to every week and every summer. The games were so fun and engaging that I didn't realize until later that they were designed to help kids like me with social and coping skills. Each game had a back-story and funny characters, perfect for a wondering mind and big imagination. The activities were a mental and physical outlet, but unlike many traditional activities and sports, the kids weren't in competition with each other, and the more we supported each other, the more easily we ""won"" the challenge. There was humor, silliness, and camaraderie. I felt like one of the gang, and I looked forward to seeing all my friends. We learned boundaries in real time, and when I acted out I was gently but firmly guided back to appropriate behavior without being embarrassed or stigmatized. I credit Academy for helping me develop the tools and confidence that make me a well-adjusted, but still true to self, 30-something year-old.",3 years ago,2020-08-20T13:01:58,Hi Stevie...nah...Hi Stephanie (you'll always be Stephanie to me).

Tall grass everywhere on the trail, we didn't even do more than a third of the trail to have 50 ticks on the dog.

Maybe they could put some signage up to warn people about ticks for less knowledgeable people to be up front. Have donated hundreds of dollars in last year and it obviously doesn't go to maintaining their HQ trail.",2 years ago,2022-05-23T17:50:24,,,,2,,,False,,,[]

cancelled our reservations twice and called the police on us for trespassing.

After having made reservations several weeks in advance, my friends and I arrived at the facility to find it unlocked and empty. After contacting the employee who scheduled our reservation, we were informed that they had forgotten about us and our group was asked to leave. We were frustrated, but agreed to reschedule for early the next morning.

While walking out to our cars the police arrived. Fortunately, they were very understanding of the scheduling mishap and we were dismissed without issue.

Later that day, we received a text message stating that no employees were available to accommodate our rescheduled reservation, and that they were cancelling on us again.

We finally got a call back where we were notified that they had a lapse in scheduling and did not have any one available and that they needed us to leave the facility per their policy. We asked since we had some flights early afternoon Sunday if we could reschedule for 8 am on Sunday, he agreed. As we were walking out of the facility, three police cars showed up and said they had received a call for trespassing.

When I originally had him evaluated, they told me he just needed to work on a straighter kick  and pointed toes.  We swim regularly, and I noticed that after 2 months of lessons, there was zero improvement.  If anything, his kick had gotten significantly worse.  And he had started coming out of streamline positions to doggy paddle.  Observing this, I checked in with the instructor, and the evaluator told me that he was doing a hybrid breast/freestyle kick with very bent legs.  (Which he had not been doing previously).
When I asked my son (he is 9 years old) about what he did in his lessons, he told me that they had him and another kid just kicking and racing across the pool, with little instruction.  Thankfully, last week was parent observation.  I watched as for the entire first 20 minutes,  as he did 4 laps kicking (incorrectly) with a barbell, breathing forward.  He received zero feedback or encouragement from the instructor.  We pulled him out of lessons that day.  $450 to be a worse swimmer!!!! What a rip-off!!!
