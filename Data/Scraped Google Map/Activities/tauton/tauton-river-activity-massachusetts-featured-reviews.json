Olivia placed a few pizza slices on plates and then left the room. The pizza was cold and stale by the time it was served, and Olivia was absent, failing to assist with serving the pizza, cutting the cake, or cleaning up afterwards.\n\nMoreover, our time felt rushed as Olivia began setting up for the next party while we were still with our guests, indicating insufficient time allocated between parties. We were also given the responsibility to distribute cards to the children. The service was severely lacking throughout the event. Furthermore, Olivia repeatedly pressured us to settle the bill/check out, interrupting the party to ask about payment four times, leading to an uncomfortable situation where we had to check out amidst the celebration.

Unfortunately I just can't recommend this place.\nThere's some peculiarities to this campground that I've never seen before. First of all, they have a very strict no visitor policy. If you are not on the reservation you are not allowed in the campground. Most of the campsites are okay but there are a few that are literally so slanted you could not even pitch a tent yet alone park your car..\nThe pond has a iron algae bloom and makes the water have this very strange oil slick appearance. It's completely harmless but I'm sure to some people is concerning. If you're allergic to pollen, stay away as it gets pretty brutal.\nThe next thing is the very noticeable amount of homeless people who are living in this campground. There were very clearly three obvious ones when we arrived on Friday night and this morning a police escort of three cruisers came to basically kick these people out. They had a microwave, a mattress and everything. There are people that will run extension cords out of the bathroom outlets and have surge protectors plugged in with all of their phones and accessories charging. You can only buy firewood with a credit card and not by cash which is probably the only place I've ever seen do that. The people that come here are completely ignorant and use the driving road as a walking path and literally will not move out of your way when you're trying to drive back to your site. As I wrote this I also noticed a couple Nice big widowmakers as we call them. Dead branches that are either already broken off and just hanging on other branches or ones that will come down very soon. These are extremely dangerous and should be taken down by the park staff, it's really not that hard..\n\nNo of course it's not all bad. It was relatively quiet this weekend aside from one spot that was being a little loud. The pond is great to fish in and of course it's close to home, this price is per night are also very reasonable for a tent site.\n\nIf you're looking for a actual camping experience, drive an hour away either to New Hampshire Connecticut and you will find yourself in a much better situation than this.", "published_at": "a month ago", "published_at_date": "2019-01-03T20:17:34", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 1, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLZ6SWVYvsQPh2rFjoBsDIXLqgX3rIM6bCy4Y1=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdBAhDAutIXcO3STTTDAOtR0sp_Rp1LtKDXPOd=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9lDsGM0LJTqeqhU-vFwNbv8hw1xLzL2BK0c9g=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJN4XBEauM5IkRrnAheRtPQ5I", "place_name": "Taunton Green", "review_id": "ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROX2FXSkp3EAE", "rating": 5, "review_text": "The city did a great job this year with their Christmas decorations.

Park rangers are nice and friendly. There isn't a life guard on site. There are fishing spots off to the sides of the swimming beach. You can also bring your canoe and paddle boats. I'm not sure about motorized boats. Definitely a nice alternative to the beach on days that cooler near the ocean, but warm inland and its close to home.

Thank you!!!!\n\nAnd there are bathrooms open, but they closed well before the park did.\n\nCool history and very accessible.

Tonya helped redefine my life, my attitude towards the gym/working out & helped me become the person I am today; Someone who is proud to come to the gym, someone who loves to move her body, someone who feels strong & excited to be living a completely different, happier and active life.. All the things I dreamed of for so long. I couldn't have done this without Tonya by my side through it all.\n\nAfter a year of personal training, I started hybrid training classes which opened me up to a community of people who have cheered me on, pushed me, supported me and truly inspired me to keep up with my lifestyle & goals.

Then my wedding dress needed to be taken in. That's when I saw results.\n\nI thought Tonya would just tell me how to work out- but our training sessions went beyond that. She not only taught me the fundamentals about proper nutrition to fuel my weight lifting, but also gave me sample meals, recipes, and motivation to eat well. We got as specific on where to buy food, which protein was the cheapest at which grocery store, and what flavors we liked in certain meals. Her guidance completely changed how I look at and navigate food and eating. In my 20+ weeks of training, I learned how to properly fuel my body and saw the direct results Tonya said I would see when I abided by her code.\n\nIn the gym, I felt myself completely transform. Even when I didn't workout with Tonya, I heard her in my head, either with the tailored videos she constantly sent me, or figuratively coaching me through sets as I imagined her in my head pushing me.\n\nI constantly yearned to workout, and made myself workout even on the toughest days. I lifted hard and heavy, which was something I had never done before.\n\nIn terms of personalization in my personal training- I threw every possible obstacle at Tonya- multiple injuries, a bad reaction to antibiotics, and a total career change- all mid-season. Tonya met every challenge head-on WITH me, and catered my nutrition and workout plans and goals accordingly.\n\nI made tons of mistakes- from completely skipping workouts to eating share size bags of skittles in one sitting, but Tonya never once judged me or shamed me. We pushed through these little fails together and continues to reach my goals.\n\nI can not recommend the personal training program at Sheepdog athletics enough.", "published_at": "4 months ago", "published_at_date": "2024-03-03T14:03:35", "response_from_owner_text": null, "response_from_owner_ago": null, "response_from_owner_date": null, "review_likes_count": 1, "total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer": null, "total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer": null, "is_local_guide": false, "review_translated_text": null, "response_from_owner_translated_text": null, "review_photos": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsiEQHliCdpfRiIWv7fpobdgmnGXlFoKBf05YF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"place_id": "ChIJQULGoayM5IkRmqIITX5xue0", "place_name": "Sheepdog Athletics & Fitness", "review_id": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOWNxWTRBRRAB", "rating": 5, "review_text": "This place is Awesome! worth every penny! if you stay consistent and put in the work you will start seeing results!

My 14-year-old son is into genealogy and they were great about setting him up in the research library.\nAfter our visit we asked if there was anything else of interest in the area (as we are from out of state) and a local event was suggested - which turned out to be amazing! All around, a great experience.\nI highly recommend this quaint, immaculate, informative museum.", "published_at": "4 weeks ago", "published_at_date": "2024-06-27T05:08:39", "response_from_owner_text": "Thank you so much!

However, lately I haven't been impressed with the customer service. There seems to always be a new glass bottle shattered in the parking lot, and the staff NEVER cleans it up. I understand if it continues to happen it can be frustrating, but when it is crowded and that is the only spot to park in, I don't want to pop my tires. It also is alarming because you can't even see until you pull into the spot with the massive glass shards! Secondly, the staff has always been amazing. Lately, though, there has been new and younger kids working which some of them are great, but the majority stand there chatting amongst themselves failing to greet members coming and going, which was always my favorite part about being a member there. On multiple occasions I've said hello and goodbye, without hearing anything from the workers... they just stand and stare or are too busy on their phones/gossiping. The girls seem to stand in groups behind the desk and one of the nights I went, they were too busy flirting with a male member to answer a question I had regarding my husbands membership. He stood at the other side of the desk chatting with them for well over 30 minutes which screams unprofessional to me. I would love to see more doing and less socialization... I don't feel nearly as welcome as I used to with Tyler and the old staff.
