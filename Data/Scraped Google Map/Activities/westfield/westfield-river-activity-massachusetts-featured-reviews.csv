There's an excellent playground with equipment, swings, slides, sandbox and seesaws.
There's nature trails and plenty of picnic tables.
There's beautiful trees, plants, and fields.
Rose garden, duck pond, tea house.
The list goes on, it's just a nice place to be outside enjoying nature.
There are very nice pavilions available for rental too.

Be aware there is NO SMOKING anywhere at the park, you can be subject to a fine.
There is also no picnicking or dogs allowed in the rose garden.
Professional photographers need to buy a pass.

Don't feed the ducks/geese/fish bread, only seed and food from the feeder machines (take quarters). Don't try to touch the birds or let your kids touch them.

Its still weird that the membership is not pro rated, but in retrospec its still cheaper than other range memberships in the area by far with alot more to offer.

My only other gripe is that guests even with LTC are not allowed to join you to shoot, they must become a member. But again, this works both ways are a plus so you don't have random non members increasing risk of an incident.

ChIJK-t61g8f54kR9MuVGgKbzRU,Westfield Sportsmen Club,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzbFBtR0NnEAE,5,"To answer some of these issues. WSC have new directors. If someone is rude to you, contact the President asap. We have a membership of over 1400 people. We want everyone to enjoy their time at WSC.
If you wish to bring someone to the range for a tour, there is a range officer there and after signing a waiver, the range officer will gladly give you a tour. Guns are involved here, thus the liability is high. Insurance and city rules and state law require you to sign a waiver.
There are state and federal laws, read them. No person under the age of 21 can handle a firearm in the state of Massachusetts. So no you cannot bring someone to shoot underage, Long guns such as rifles and shotguns may be shot by a person over age 12 under the direction of an instructor or the childs parents. They must have a waiver signed by the parent, and possess a state mandated FID card at the appropriate age. that's the law. if other ranges allow otherwise, I would report them immediately.
there was an incident with a child several years ago due to a irresponsible parent and event sponsor. Sure we would love to introduce kids the world of firearms, but it has to be responsible and under the laws of the state. again if the child is under 12 and is shooting, it is illegal here.
IF YOUR LTC is expired, and you do not have a current one in hand, you now illegally possess a firearm no matter if you own it or not, this is a state law, read it. It does not matter if you reapplied, until you have it in hand, you will go to jail if caught with a firearm, PERIOD. If you wish to join another range, with a expired permit, even if the other one is on the way, you open up the range to millions in liability, and you jail time where you will never see your permit again ever, then go ahead. WSC will not allow you to join with out producing a valid LTC or FID. you may get a membership to use the other facilities and when you get your permit you can get full use of the ranges.
Hope this clears up the complaints, if you  have a problem at WSC, please contact the President, instead of complaining here, we will address any issues you have. Research the laws before placing blame on WSC. Once a accident happens at another range, they will start following the laws. The three closest ranges in the area aside of WSC allow members to break state and federal laws all day long, I have seen it for myself. Our rules follow all laws, and protect you and everyone on WSC property.",4 years ago,2020-01-23T04:41:05,,,,3,,,False,,,[]

>> Middle Section * Cascades
- First waterpool, and look across the water from shoreline level to the base of a tree.. you'll notice a little ""Fairy Box"" built into it, please don't disturb it. Thank you!

ChIJC2wizkwZ54kR2gdlB5vBCHA,Woronoco Falls,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkdEx2NE5nEAE,4,"Woronoco Falls: A Hidden Gem in Western Massachusetts

Nestled in the small town of Russell, Massachusetts, Woronoco Falls offers a picturesque escape into nature. The waterfall cascades down a series of rocky ledges, creating a mesmerizing display of water and moss-covered stone.

What to expect:

Short Hike: The falls are accessible via a short, easy hike along a mostly flat trail, making it suitable for most visitors.
Picturesque Setting: The surrounding woodlands, especially vibrant during the fall foliage season, create a stunning backdrop for the waterfall.
Swimming Hole: A small pool at the base of the falls is popular for cooling off on warm days.
Tips:

Best after rain: The falls are most impressive after a recent rainfall.
Picnic Spot: Pack a lunch and enjoy a peaceful picnic by the water.
Footwear: Wear comfortable shoes suitable for a short walk in the woods.

Overall, Woronoco Falls is a lovely destination for a quick nature break and excellent if you're looking for a charming, lesser-known spot to explore in the area.",5 months ago,2024-02-21T09:31:07,,,,0,,,False,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRc-asMQi4WIWt3tzJwgZmec52HS6jTL7A7y1I=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjvbJ7yTl7nARAvO6zG_JTQHwjYo0hNbPRkKCg=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMA4nbNWi3MmjDmBd9SRa9NJxUBKje0karwHNOL=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgS5z9satA76viOfO-ZauOOPLVM-Cm-aPMD6A4=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGj4ts3SFlCmaLsx4pFVQ8xvnJnqA9Qn0ZVgK7=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgGc-v4UQ8fb-4fG4QYwiRtaNx1Y7tfIVM_PzS=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGF_IhrHJdk_SnndDbI2ZyX5Bbp5fv36cUgKvg=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMs9ESMnGFUaeqZAojEQOGyPR0_Nl3qKiCmrGAC=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7Q4TV4c3vyHSUF3LS1D3AoaOyRtq0SKg04gA_=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbY-MpRIbGRXl1Tqh0ZerTczLcRHKacJnz388p=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-MoSgW2DoqPkscOrIXdqIpGUkzwcl-nvcPBGD=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQHBtFMUciusC-TpC7K8ruthgLWH6ph-eLRBqX=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_3cauL6flzF7--KPk1JbSTw27OHpfxsPcHgh8=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnH39ohQXUBgUhs0mgoGnMcRWGhKffaTjrBK23=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoaYrT-bYQpu3gMAHZ-NzcM47sj7Ia5AebZQLR=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjcztrtgZEuN9zYK7xL7v21v-uhIvvwTnmVeFb=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiVJXb-BS8SMw9i-YGsE0j8pp-RdQlr8qhufgQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF5scQmLlo9WM46Zup_Cl2W48KwcVdvCg0Mmyz=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWp1Mgylgve3oWk2WRbeQcwhBld4GWp9IZfqn4=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOPpIMHRsUAqm3hQtT4ke_wKDDTWk2bSVrxp3t=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNio4C5UomycfesuMtLGLKjAfCrm_vAyTqCwmEs=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqXro2xq-4iFb44nlYKgH8N1g5Oxjej6IkvK5x=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMM7M52sColpfP5W4y_P_KQiL_EuxWLcURB7maj=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

ChIJYQu-rvQf54kRKwuVAoqaaV8,Team Link Westfield Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0aEllNFhREAE,5,"I have been a member of Team Link since 2016 on and off due to recovery from different kind of sports injuries or car accidents. I love BJJ and atmosphere in Team Link so I always come back to training whenever my body starts feeling  better. . There are several  "" team link ""gyms in other towns beside this fairly new one in Westfield. What  is nice about  having such a great big community is - I was able to train under many instructors  and get so much more experience . Some memberships allow  you to go to any team link gym regardless of the town.
Last year , I joined team link in Westfield for many reasons and I hope I can  encourage you to join as well. :)
First of all , as I mentioned before it is a new gym that just opened up in September 2023 - it is the biggest by size in the area and has new MATTS- the best quality ones (when you land you barely feel lol ), second - wonderful, knowledgeable instructors ( black and brown belts ) . Each of them is fantastic.
Third - as a woman,  I never feel as I need to worry about someone being too harsh with me . They are plenty of strong and mighty women there to begin with  haha and even if I end up to have a male partner - all of them are super nice and there is no bad blood between anyone. Everyone works as a team and helps each other in a nice friendly atmosphere. In fact - this is the best time to join if you are new to MMA or BJJJ since a lot of new members joined and  you can easily catch up with presented techniques if you come consistently. There are classes for kids too. You have so many sessions available -from evenings and mornings - which is  my fourth reason I joined. I love the morning Tuesdays and Thursdays sessions at 9:30 am ( thank you  to my great instructors Tom, Brian and Jovan for their patience,encouragement and attention to details and to all my friendly colleagues at team link  ).  I also come in the evenings when I can and everyone there is super nice too !
When you join and you are new to MMA - you won't be sparring right away until you learn the basics which provides everyone with additional safety and helps us all to decrease unnecessary injuries.
So , here we come to my fifth and last reason why I chose Team Link  - it provides safe and pleasant environment to train regardless of you age or gender . When you work with your partner you need to be honest about any injuries you might be recovering from and no one here will be trying to work against you but with you !!!! We are all here to WIN against our ""own self "" and become a better or best version of "" you "" .

When you ready to join ( or want to learn more )speak to Tom. He will do all the paperwork with you.
If it was not for him I probably would not have join again last year but he always  encourages me to do the best I can , even when my body does not always cooperate. No one here forces you to do ALL techniques and if for some reason you cannot perform it -you don't have to .
Thank you to Marco Alvan our head coach/instructor #1  from
Ludlow ( you have always been so kind to me ) and other instructors from Northampton that helped my growth so much  ( Gary and his wonderful  wife Jeileen) - and to many more that had been there for me since the beginning. Love you all !!!!!

Parking is easy (even if the lot is full, street parking is only 2mins away). Entry is quick and painless, concessions are fast and lines are short. Food cost is low and beer cost is about $5.00 for domestic and $6 for premium. Beer garden is a good idea however, you can get stuck as you can only walk to it between 1/2  innings. Not a deal breaker just something to note.

Reserving a seat is easy and the seats have tons of room for legs, knees and elbows. Seats and GA along the left field / first base side get shade first but every seat gives you a great view. It seems like sunflower seeds don't get cleaned up as well as they could be but, the seating area is relatively clean.

Staff is excellent, and restrooms are about the norm for a college game (not super clean but definitely fine to use)

The stone bridges towering over the river are very impressive, but even without the bridges, the river views are spectacular. This route gains a modest amount of elevation going out, as the path travels upriver. The trail is mostly easy walking, often wide enough for two people to walk comfortably side by side. Some sections are a bit muddy. In one section, the trail turns right, narrows and gains a bit of elevation before a footbridge crosses a cascading stream, then winds down to follow the river again. There are a few opportunities to venture off the main KAB trail (blazed with blue metal tags); these offshoots can provide the best views of the bridges.

We purchased the property a couple years ago after being neglected for years and have been working hard to bring it back to life. We are in contract with Allied Flooring to replace the worn out greens on our miniature golf. Please consider coming back over the summer and you will see the nice greens as well as many other improvements. Thank you for your feedback.
